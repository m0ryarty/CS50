sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because in worst case (big O) the algorithm tneds to n square, but is better in in a better case (big omega). In my results, "sort1" takes a worst results in shuffled data and improved when data is sorted or reversed.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it takes better results in all sets of data. And the diference apears more clear when the data is more shuffled.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Since the big o and big omega is the same and the results shows this behavior, more clear with more data.
